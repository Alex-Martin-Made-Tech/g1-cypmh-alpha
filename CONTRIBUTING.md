# Contribution guidelines

We really like contributions and bug reports, in fact the project wouldn't have got to this stage without them.
We do have a few guidelines to bear in mind.

## Contributing

If youâ€™ve got an idea or suggestion you can:

* email [service-manual@nhs.net](mailto:service-manual@nhs.net)
* [get in touch on developer Slack channel](https://nhs-service-manual.slack.com/messages/CFYL2GDGW)
* [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-prototype-kit/issues/new)   

## Raising bugs

When raising bugs please explain the issue in good detail and provide a guide to how to replicate it.

## Suggesting features

Please raise feature requests as issues before contributing any code.

This ensures they are discussed properly before any time is spent on them.
