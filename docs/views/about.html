      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>The NHS.UK prototype kit provides a simple way to make interactive prototypes that look like pages on NHS.UK. These prototypes can be used to show ideas to people you work with, and to do user research.</p>

      <h2>Support</h2>
      
      <p>The NHS.UK prototype kit is maintained by NHS Digital. If you’ve got a question or need support you can:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="mailto:service-manual@nhs.net">email us</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://nhsuk.slack.com/messages/standards" rel="nofollow">get in touch on the NHS.UK #standards Slack channel</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/nhsuk/nhsuk-prototype-kit/issues">view known issues on GitHub</a></li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Contributing</h2>
      
      <p>If you’ve got an idea or suggestion you can:</p>

      <ul>

      </ul>

      <h2>Privacy</h2>

      <p>You must protect user privacy at all times, even when using prototypes. Prototypes made with the kit look like NHS.UK, but do not have the same security provisions. Always make sure you are handling user data appropriately.</p>

      <h2>The kit is not a production framework</h2>
     
      <p>Things made with the kit may look like NHS.UK, but do not have production code and likely aren't fully accessible. Don't use the kit as a base for a production service.</p>
