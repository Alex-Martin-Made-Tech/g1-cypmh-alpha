  <h2>Terminal basics</h2>

  <p>The terminal lets you type in commands and run programs on your computer.</p>
  
  <p>You can also use it to browse your file system - to open folders, etc.</p>

  <p>Learning a few basic terminal commands can make using the kit much easier.</p>

  </ul>

  <h2>Go to your prototype</h2>

  <p>You need to navigate to your prototype in the terminal. Most commands for the kit need to be run in the prototype folder.</p>

  <pre class="app-pre"><code class="app-code">cd ~/projects/juggling-licence-prototype</code></pre>

  <p><strong>Please note:</strong> Make sure your prototype folder has the same name and location as in <a href="/docs/install/mac/where-to-keep">step 7</a>.</p>
