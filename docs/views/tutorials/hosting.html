        Hosting your prototype on Heroku
      </h1>

      <p>Use <a href="">Heroku</a> to quickly get your prototype online.</p>

      <p>Having your prototype online will allow others to access it. </p>

      <div class="nhsuk-inset-text">
        <p>DO NOT enter real user data in to prototypes hosted on Heroku. If your prototype stores or collects user data, talk to a security professional about appropriate security steps you must take.</p>
      </div>

      <p>A prototype deployed on Heroku is called an <code>app</code> - it will have a url like: your-prototype.herokuapp.com.</p>

      <p>You can have multiple apps running on Heroku - projects often have several so they can try different ideas out at once.</p>
